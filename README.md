Continuously developing personal project written in C++. In essence it simulates a game without a game engine.
All it does is create player objects with variables like armor which in turn gives hp when worn. When you press start in the programs menu, it starts the regeneration of health points. My aim is to include mana regeneration and also abilities.

If you want to compile the code yourself:
`clang++ -std=c++20 main.cpp -o main`
